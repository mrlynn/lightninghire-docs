# Bulk Operations

Bulk operations in Recruiters Assistant allow you to efficiently manage multiple records at once, saving you significant time and effort in your recruitment process.

## Overview

The bulk operations feature enables you to:

- Import multiple job listings at once
- Import multiple candidate profiles simultaneously
- Use standardized templates for consistent data structure
- Process large datasets efficiently

These operations are particularly useful when:

- Setting up the system for the first time
- Migrating from another recruitment system
- Working with large hiring campaigns
- Receiving candidate lists from external sources

## Accessing Bulk Operations

To access the bulk operations section:

1. Log in to your Recruiters Assistant account
2. Click on the "Bulk Operations" option in the dashboard
3. Select the operation you wish to perform:
   - Bulk Import Jobs
   - Bulk Import Candidates

> **Warning:** Bulk operations are limited based on your subscription plan. Free accounts can import up to 25 records at once, while Premium accounts can import up to 500 records.

## Available Operations

### Bulk Import Jobs

## Best Practices

To ensure successful bulk operations:

1. **Always use the provided templates** - This ensures data compatibility
2. **Review data before importing** - Catch formatting issues early
3. **Start with a small test batch** - Especially when importing for the first time
4. **Check validation results** - Address any flagged issues
5. **Verify imports** - Confirm all records were imported correctly

> **Info:** For large datasets, consider breaking your imports into multiple batches of 100-200 records for easier validation and troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues with bulk operations include:

- **Invalid Data Format**: Ensure your CSV/Excel file follows the template format exactly
- **Missing Required Fields**: Fill in all required fields (marked with * in templates)
- **Duplicate Entries**: Remove duplicates before importing
- **Import Limits**: Verify your subscription allows the number of records you're trying to import
